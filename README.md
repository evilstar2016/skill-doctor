## Why

Agent Skill ecosystems grow fast. You install skills from GitHub, from colleagues, from guides — and eventually your agent starts behaving inconsistently. The root cause is often two skills competing for the same trigger, or a duplicate installed in different paths, or a skill with suspicious instructions you never reviewed.

`skill-doctor` is `npm audit` for your skills. It doesn't install or distribute skills — it diagnoses the ones you already have.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g skill-doctor
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx skill-doctor scan
```

Requires Node.js 20+.

## Commands

### `scan`

Discover all installed skills and show a health summary.

```bash
skill-doctor scan
skill-doctor scan --scope project          # project skills only
skill-doctor scan --scope global           # global skills only
skill-doctor scan --report                 # write skill-doctor-report.html
skill-doctor scan --report ./out/report.html
skill-doctor scan --json
```

### `show`

Inspect a single skill — description, triggers, when to use, related skills.

```bash
$ skill-doctor show git-workflow

  SKILL: git-workflow
  Platform: claude  |  Scope: project
  Source: .claude/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md

  PROVENANCE
    Install source: .claude/skills
    Scope: project
    Confidence: high

  DESCRIPTION
    Manages git branches, commits, and pull requests following
    conventional commit standards.

  WHEN TO USE
    Use this skill when managing Git branches, commits, and pull requests
    to enforce conventional commit standards during development workflows.

  RELATED SKILLS
    github-automation    similarity: 0.36    shared: branch, commit, git
```

```bash
skill-doctor show git-workflow --json
```

### `conflicts`

List skills with overlapping descriptions or trigger keywords.

```bash
$ skill-doctor conflicts

  DUPLICATES

  ppt-master  [2 copies]
    ~/.claude/skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md
    .claude/skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md

  CONFLICTS

  git-workflow <-> github-automation
  severity: low
  method: token
  similarity: 0.36
  shared: branch, commit, git, pull, request
  fix: Refine trigger keywords so they don't overlap. Consider narrowing each skill's description.

  ppt-master <-> slide-builder
  severity: low
  method: token
  similarity: 0.29
  shared: point, power, presentation, slide
  fix: Refine trigger keywords so they don't overlap. Consider narrowing each skill's description.

  SUGGESTIONS

  consider removing: ~/.claude/skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md
    keep: .claude/skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md  (newer (modified 2026-05-15))
```

```bash
skill-doctor conflicts --kind duplicate    # exact name duplicates only
skill-doctor conflicts --kind conflict     # semantic overlaps only
skill-doctor conflicts --scope global
skill-doctor conflicts --limit 10
skill-doctor conflicts --fail-on high      # exit 1 if any HIGH conflicts (CI)
skill-doctor conflicts --analyze           # LLM-powered root cause (requires config)
```

**Detection strategies**

| Strategy | How it works | When to use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `token` (default) | TF-IDF keyword overlap | Fast, no dependencies |
| `embedding` | Cosine similarity via local embedding model | More accurate, requires config |

```bash
skill-doctor conflicts --strategy embedding
skill-doctor conflicts --strategy embedding --threshold 0.75
```

### `audit`

Scan skills for security risks — credential exposure, destructive instructions, shell execution.

```bash
$ skill-doctor audit

  Skill Safety Audit — 15 skills scanned

  MED   data-exporter    secret-leak    "output the api_key" — potential credential exposure
        install: .claude/skills  scope: project  confidence: high
  LOW   data-exporter    network-call   "curl https://" — external network request
        install: .claude/skills  scope: project  confidence: high

  2 findings  (0 high · 1 med · 1 low)
```

```bash
skill-doctor audit --severity high         # high findings only
skill-doctor audit --fail-on med           # exit 1 on med+ (CI)
skill-doctor audit --report                # write skill-doctor-audit.html
skill-doctor audit --json
```

**Built-in rules**

| Rule | Severity | Detects |
|------|----------|---------|
| `shell-exec` | HIGH | Instructions to run shell commands (`bash -c`, `eval`, `subprocess`) |
| `destructive` | HIGH | Destructive operations (`rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `wipe the database`) |
| `secret-leak` | MED | Instructions that output credentials, API keys, or passwords |
| `network-call` | LOW | Instructions that POST or upload to external URLs |

### `diff`

Compare two skills side by side — coverage, pros/cons, when to pick each.

```bash
skill-doctor diff git-workflow github-automation
skill-doctor diff git-workflow github-automation --report
```

With LLM analysis configured, `diff` adds coverage overlap, strengths/weaknesses, and situational recommendations.

### `cleanup`

Find duplicate skills across all paths and interactively remove the extras.

```bash
skill-doctor cleanup                       # show duplicates and suggested removals
skill-doctor cleanup --execute             # interactive: pick which copy to delete
skill-doctor cleanup --json
```

### `dashboard`

Generate a unified Mission Control–style HTML dashboard combining all diagnostics — scan, conflicts, audit, and cleanup — in a single page.

```bash
skill-doctor dashboard                           # writes skill-doctor-dashboard.html
skill-doctor dashboard --report ./out/dash.html  # custom output path
skill-doctor dashboard --open                    # open in browser after generating
skill-doctor dashboard --scope project           # project skills only
```

The dashboard shows:

- **Health ring** — donut chart with the proportion of clean, conflicting, at-risk, and duplicate skills
- **Platform distribution** — horizontal bar chart of skills per platform
- **Skill inventory** — full table with status indicators (conflict / risk / duplicate / clean)
- **Conflicts** — severity distribution bar and conflict pair cards with similarity scores
- **Security audit** — 4-rule heatmap (shell-exec, destructive, secret-leak, network-call) and finding detail cards
- **Cleanup suggestions** — duplicate skill pairs with keep/remove recommendations

## Platform coverage

| Platform | Global path | Project path |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/rules/` | `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/` |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `.gemini/skills/`, `GEMINI.md` |
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` | `.windsurfrules` |
| **Kiro** | `~/.kiro/skills/` | `.kiro/skills/` |
| **Trae** | `~/.trae/skills/` | `.trae/skills/` |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | `skills/`, `AGENTS.md` |
| **OpenClaw** | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | — |
| **Hermes** | `~/.config/hermes/skills/` | — |

Additional directories can be added via `paths.extra` in config (see Configuration).

## HTML reports

Several commands support `--report` to write a self-contained HTML file. `dashboard` always writes an HTML file (no flag needed).

```bash
skill-doctor dashboard                             # unified Mission Control dashboard
skill-doctor scan --report
skill-doctor audit --report
skill-doctor diff git-workflow github-automation --report
```

## CI integration

Use `--fail-on` to gate your pipeline on skill health:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/skill-check.yml
- name: Check skill conflicts
  run: npx skill-doctor conflicts --fail-on high

- name: Security audit
  run: npx skill-doctor audit --fail-on med
```

Use `--json` for custom reporting:

```bash
skill-doctor scan --json | jq '.summary'
skill-doctor audit --json | jq '.findings[] | select(.severity == "high")'
```

## Configuration

`~/.skill-doctor/config.json`

```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    "model": "bge-m3",
    "apiKey": "optional"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "apiKey": "sk-...",
    "timeoutMs": 30000
  },
  "ignore": {
    "skillNames": ["legacy-skill"],
    "conflictPairs": [["skill-a", "skill-b"]]
  },
  "paths": {
    "extra": ["/team/shared-skills", "~/my-custom-skills"]
  }
}
```

**`embedding`** — enables `--strategy embedding` for semantic conflict detection. Compatible with any OpenAI-format endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, etc.).

**`analysis`** — enables `--analyze` on `conflicts` and powers the `diff` command with LLM-generated summaries and fix suggestions. Any OpenAI-compatible model works.

**`ignore`** — suppress known false positives. `skillNames` excludes a skill from all checks; `conflictPairs` suppresses a specific pair from conflict output.

**`paths.extra`** — additional directories to scan, on top of the built-in platform paths. Each path is scanned as a skill-dirs layout (same structure as `~/.claude/skills/`). Supports `~` for home directory.
